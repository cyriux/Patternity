# Basic models for testing purpose: planning agile project

> User **stories** are one of the primary development artifacts for Scrum and Extreme Programming (XP)

&mdash; [Introduction to User Stories](http://www.agilemodeling.com/artifacts/userStory.htm)

An **epic** is essentially a large user **story** that can be broken up into several smaller user stories.
**Epics** are typically used to capture large and complex items from the product backlog that are low
priority and are yet to be defined in great detail.
Each **Epic** **Card** is then coupled with a pack of **story** cards (some story cards may be small enough
to be **task** cards) which are automatically produced by a rather nifty excel spreadsheet that I concocted. This could in effect replace your product backlog.

**Comment** can be added to either **Epic**, **Story** or **Card**...
